### What I learned

While working on this project, I became more confident using Flexbox and its alignment tools, including display: flex, flex-direction, align-items, and justify-content.

I learned that when styling text inside a button, especially when different words need different colors, it’s better to use a (span) element instead of a (p) element. (p) is block-level and takes up the full width, which can push other text onto a new line, whereas (span) is inline and allows text to flow naturally.

I also recognized the importance of spelling CSS properties correctly, since even small mistakes can prevent styles from applying properly.

I learned how to use z-index to control the vertical stacking order of overlapping elements and how flex-wrap allows flex items to move onto multiple lines when needed. I also became familiar with order, which lets you change the visual order of flex items without modifying the HTML structure—a technique especially useful for responsive layouts.

Finally, this project strengthened my understanding of CSS positioning, layout, and design, and taught me how to use media queries to create a responsive website that adapts smoothly to different devices and screen sizes.


### Continued development

In future projects, I want to further improve my use of Flexbox and media queries to create more flexible, fully responsive layouts, like the ones I worked on for positioning the images and banner in my Meet landing page. I also aim to strengthen my understanding of CSS positioning and z-index for managing overlapping elements, and to write cleaner, more reusable CSS for polished and adaptable designs.
